##Gateway Web Client

Gateway is an online craigslist-like marketplace for people looking to exchange services and help each other out. It was built by me and two other students during our CS 4261 Mobile Apps & Services class. Users that need help accomplishing some sort of goal can create new listings detailing what type of service they need and when they need it (car maintenance, wedding photography, moving services, etc) and users who can provide services can search through listings, find listings that match their skillset and get in contact with the original listing owner effotlessly. There's also [a promo video][1] for Gateway explaining its core interaction model on YouTube.

The app is built with [AngularJS][2], [Bootstrap][3], and [Angular UI Router][4]. It is far from feature complete, but it demonstrates how Angular makes two-way data binding and using nested views effortless.
